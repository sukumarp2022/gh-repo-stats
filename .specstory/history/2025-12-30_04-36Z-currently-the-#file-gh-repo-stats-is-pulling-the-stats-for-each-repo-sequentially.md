# Currently the #file:gh-repo-stats is pulling the stats for each repo sequentially.  (2025-12-30 04:36Z)

Currently the #file:gh-repo-stats is pulling the stats for each repo sequentially. 
Can you optimize it so that I can run them in batches. 
Add a flag for running the command - batch
it should take an integer and the batch is the number that says how many repo stats API calls are made parallelly. 
Create a new branch called - `sukumar-optimization` and then make these changes.

The user wants me to:
1. Create a new branch called `sukumar-optimization`
2. Modify the `gh-repo-stats` script to add a batch processing feature
3. Add a `-b` or `--batch` flag that takes an integer for parallel API calls

Let me first create the branch, then read more of the script to understand the structure better, and then implement the batch processing optimization.I'll help you optimize the script to run repo stats in batches with parallel processing. Let me first create the branch and then read more of the script to understand the structure better.
